Vidalia is currently developed by:
  Matt Edman <edmanm@vidalia-project.net>


Contributors:
  Domenik Bork was a Google Summer of Code student during Summer 2008 and
  added the hidden service configuration interface.

  Ren Bucholz <http://homes.eff.org/~renbucholz/tor/> created some of the
  onion images off of which Corinna's icons and some of our own images are
  based. 
  
  Dan Christensen <http://opello.org/> added additional image formats to 
  the .ico files to support more Windowses. He also created the graph style
  icons in the bandwidth graph settings.

  dr|z3d created the Vidalia logo design and image files and helped redesign
  the Vidalia website.

  Geoff Goodell <http://afs.eecs.harvard.edu/~goodell/> supplied us with
  nearly all of the flag icons that we use in the Appearance configuration
  page and network map. He also created the router status icons we use in 
  the network map.

  Corinna Habets <corinna@geekin.de> created the images off which
  our application icons are based.
  
  Matt Hanson <http://www.zuerchertech.com/> tweaked Corinna's images a bit
  and created some .icos based off of them. 
 
  Justin Hipple <hipplej@vidalia-project.net> co-founded the Vidalia project
  and helped with lots of the initial development.

  Andrew Lewman wrote the original Mac OS X bundle installer off which
  Vidalia's is based, and also added Torbutton to the bundle.

  This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from
  http://maxmind.com/

  Steven J. Murdoch <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/sjm217/> wrote the code
  to launch a web browser when Tor has built a circuit and close Vidalia when
  the browser has exited. He also implemented UPnP support using the MiniUPNPc
  library.

  Brandon Nase <http://www.students.dsu.edu/naseb/> designed and built 
  the original vidalia-project.net website.

  Christoph Sieghart (sigi) <http://www.0x2a.at/blog/> gave us some code that
  converts world space coordinates (latitude,longitude) into image space
  coordinates (x,y) which we used in the Net Viewer.

  Michael Zuercher and Adam Tomjack of Zuerchertech LLC
  <http://www.zuerchertech.com> gave us the ZImageView class which handles
  drawing, scrolling and zooming the map image in the Network Viewer.
